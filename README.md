## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies Data Mining and AI-enhanced analytics in the financial/business domain using Generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs). The project encompasses dataset simulation, feature engineering, predictive modelling, and model interpretation with AI support.

### Objectives
- Apply data-mining workflows in real financial/business contexts
- Integrate GenAI/LLMs/SLMs into data analysis
- Build and evaluate predictive models
- Collaborate effectively using professional GitHub practices

## 📋 Project Components

### 1️⃣ Dataset Simulation & Feature Engineering
- Simulate 1000+ financial/business-related records
- Use GenAI to create realistic numerical and textual patterns
- Apply LLMs/SLMs for feature extraction (sentiment analysis, risk categorization, customer segmentation)

### 2️⃣ Predictive Model Development 
- Develop classification/regression models using:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks
- Utilize AI tools for text-based feature engineering
- Compare results across at least two models

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation & Interpretation 
- Evaluate using appropriate metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, RMSE)
- Use LLMs to summarize findings and provide insights
- Interpret feature importance

### 4️⃣ Final Report
- 5–7 page comprehensive report
- Includes: objectives, dataset details, EDA, feature engineering, modelling, results, business insights
- AI usage disclosure and GitHub contribution summary
